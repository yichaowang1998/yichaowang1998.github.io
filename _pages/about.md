I am a final-year PhD student from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/) at the [Florida State University(FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof.Jie Yang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jieyang/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in 2020.

My research interest is mobile computing which mainly includes Wireless Sensing, Mobile Healthcare, Human-Computer Interaction Applications, Smart Home and Internet of Things (IoT) Applications.

The best way to reach me is through my email: yw20bp [AT] fsu [DOT] edu.
